# Shaders playground

A simple project I'm using to experiment with shaders using [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) and [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol), following the [Learn OpenGL Book](https://learnopengl.com/).

## Setup

```bash
./bin/setup-sokol.sh
./bin/build.sh
./target/game
```

## TODO

- [ ] revisit allocations made with `make(...)` - can i avoid these heap allocations somehow?
- [ ] exercises of [this lesson](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Lighting-maps)
